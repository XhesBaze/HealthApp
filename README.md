# HealthApp
Our project is an application meant to facilitate the life of patients, and freelance doctors of a certain clinic

the application would best serve as a middle man between the client and various private clinics (aka freelance doctors), functioning like a medical version of Baboon/Fiverr.
The project would be sold to an entrepreneur who will own this type of network.
The part of the profit that the app will generate will be a cut from every transaction that is made through the app (20% of the service price).

Users will be: guest, client, clinic, doctor and admin.
Guest and client can communicate with a chat-bot to get oriented in the program and which doctor is recommended to click.
Guests will also be able to see all other facilities they get once they are signed up, as a preview.
Clients who are signed in can contact with doctors, can access their data as well as add symptoms in real time to complete it as a profile.

When customers sign up in addition to typical fields such as first name, last name, email, etc.
They will be asked to fill out a form on their medical data to have a clearer idea of the patient's condition.
They can also have access to a food plan recommended by the algorithm in collaboration with the doctor based on the problems they have, as well as rate and review the doctor, and the clinic in general.

The doctor on the other hand, when he registers, uploads a pdf containing the notarized diploma (which also passes a verification by the admin), chats with clients, has access to his client's personal data, uploads the results of the tests as well as checks and modifies the food plan.
The doctors are connected to a clinic that supervises their daily plans and overall serves as an interface for the details of doctors that are part of the said clinic.

The clinic also has its own rating system and contact details.
The admin serves for the verification of doctors, has access to all comments and evaluations, is aware of the number of tests requested/performed/the time it took for these tests as well as the amount of profit that has come from the app at different times.
